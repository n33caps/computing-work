## For Ms Vaz <h1>

*/a poem*


Dear Ms Vaz

When you first stepped into our class
we were greeted with a laugh

At first we were a little tense
but you made everything make sense

Sometimes you are harsh on us
but I know it's just what's best for us

You never fail to make it interesting
for each lesson to not be boring
